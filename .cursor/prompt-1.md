# Mission Objective

Your primary mission is to iteratively debug a Jenkins setup defined by JCasC (`jenkins.yaml`) and a `Jenkinsfile`. You will analyze startup logs and build logs, make modifications to the files, and repeat the process until you have a fully working configuration that successfully completes a simple pipeline build.

# Context & Current State

## 1\. The Goal

I want the simplest possible setup to test a Jenkins `dockerfile` agent. **This means the pipeline script should be defined directly within the JCasC `jenkins.yaml` file.** The goal is to avoid any SCM (like Git) configuration to keep the setup minimal and focused purely on the agent's functionality for now.

## 2\. The Known Problem

The current `jenkins.yaml` fails during Jenkins startup. The logs show a clear `NullPointerException` because the `readFileFromWorkspace()` function is being called in a context where no job workspace exists.

**Key Log Snippet:**
`java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "hudson.FilePath.child(String)" because "workspace" is null`

## 3\. The File System

Here is the complete project structure and the content of each file. You have full control to modify these files.

```
.
├── docker-compose.yml (Used to run Jenkins server on host machine's Docker)
├── jenkins.yaml (❌ **This is the broken file you must fix first** ❌)
├── Jenkinsfile (This is the pipeline logic that needs to be moved into `jenkins.yaml`)
└── build/
    └── Dockerfile (Dockerfile should be used by the Jenkins `dockerfile` agent)
```

# Your Task: Iterative Debugging Workflow

Follow these steps precisely. Do not move to the next step until the previous one is confirmed to be working.

### **Step 1: Fix the Jenkins Startup Error (JCasC)**

### **Step 2: Trigger and Debug the Jenkins Build**

Once Jenkins is running successfully, you must trigger the pipeline and ensure it completes.

1.  **Request API Key:** You need an admin API token to trigger the build. Please ask me for it now by saying: **"I am ready to trigger the build. Please provide the admin API key."** I will then generate one and give it to you.
2.  **Trigger the Build:** Use the following `curl` command. Replace `<PIPELINE_NAME>` with the new job name you defined in `jenkins.yaml` and `<ADMIN_API_KEY>` with the key I provide.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/<PIPELINE_NAME>/build --user admin:<ADMIN_API_KEY>
    ```
3.  **Analyze Build Logs:** Immediately after triggering, fetch the console output for the build. Use this command:
    ```bash
    curl --user admin:<ADMIN_API_KEY> http://localhost:8080/job/<PIPELINE_NAME>/lastBuild/consoleText
    ```
4.  **Iterate and Fix:** Analyze the console output.
      * If the build fails (e.g., cannot connect to Docker daemon, syntax error in the pipeline script, file not found), diagnose the issue.
      * Modify the relevant file (`jenkins.yaml` for pipeline logic, or the `Dockerfile` if needed).
      * Restart Jenkins (`docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d --build`) if you change `jenkins.yaml`.
      * Repeat steps 2-4 until the build is successful.
5.  **Success Criterion:** The build's console output must show the pipeline executing successfully, including the output of the `ls -l` command, and end with a `Finished: SUCCESS` message.

After all the issues are fixed, give me a git commit message with all the things you did to resolve the issues.
